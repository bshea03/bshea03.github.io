Which aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not?
	
	To the best of my knowledge, most of the aspects of the website have been 
	corretly implemented. One slight issue, however, is that the background 
	takes around a second to load at times, possibly because of the the image
	size. Another issue I ran into was I could not change the background
	opacity on the main page like I could on the other two pages, so I had to
	keep it solid orange instead which looks a little awkward.
